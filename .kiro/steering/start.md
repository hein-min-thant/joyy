You are a professional UI/UX designer and front-end developer with deep knowledge of modern design systems (Tailwind, Material Design, Geist UI, Ant Design, and Next.js aesthetics).

Your task: **Redesign my entire website UI** — layout, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy — to make it look modern, consistent, and elegant.

### Website Context:
[Briefly describe your website — e.g., a CMS platform, portfolio, e-commerce, blog, etc.]

### Goals:
- Improve usability, layout flow, and readability.
- Create a clean, responsive, modern design.
- Ensure consistent typography, spacing, and alignment.
- Remove outdated or cluttered design patterns.
- Use proper visual hierarchy and whitespace.
- Avoid shadows or heavy background colors (if preferred).

### Design Direction:
[Specify one or more styles or references — e.g. "Next.js official site", "Apple website feel", "Geist UI minimalist aesthetic", "Material 3 soft surfaces"]

### Required Output:
1. **Complete Redesign Concept**
   - Describe the new layout section-by-section (header, hero, content, sidebar, footer, etc.)
   - Explain improvements from the old layout.
2. **Visual Style System**
   - Define color palette, typography (font sizes, weights, line-heights)
   - Describe button, card, and input styles
3. **Implementation Guide**
   - Suggest how to rebuild it in my framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS + React)
   - Show sample code snippets for layout and component design
4. **Optional:** Generate a modern sitemap and page structure proposal.

### Rules:
- Avoid just "tweaking" my existing layout — rethink it entirely.
- Do not copy from other sites; take inspiration but redesign with originality.
- Provide detailed reasoning for design choices.
- Be explicit about every visual element and spacing.

### Example tone/style:
- Professional
- Clean and balanced
- Modern and minimal
- Human-centered UX
