# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the manga/comic reading website UI from shadcn/ui to HeroUI (NextUI). The refactoring aims to create a professional, clean interface without purple colors or gradients, with appropriate spacing and modern UX patterns. The system currently has partial HeroUI implementation and needs complete migration of all components and pages.

## Glossary

- **HeroUI**: A modern React UI library (also known as NextUI) that provides pre-built components with built-in theming and accessibility features
- **shadcn/ui**: The current UI component library built on Radix UI primitives that needs to be replaced
- **Application**: The manga/comic reading web application built with Next.js
- **User Interface**: All visual components, pages, and layouts that users interact with
- **Theme System**: The color scheme and styling configuration that controls the visual appearance
- **Component Library**: The collection of reusable UI components used throughout the Application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all shadcn/ui dependencies and components, so that the Application uses only HeroUI components

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application is built, THE Application SHALL contain no imports from shadcn/ui component files
2. THE Application SHALL remove all Radix UI dependencies from package.json
3. THE Application SHALL delete all shadcn/ui component files from the components/ui directory
4. THE Application SHALL replace all shadcn/ui utility dependencies with HeroUI equivalents
5. WHEN the Application is deployed, THE Application SHALL function without any shadcn/ui code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean professional interface without purple colors or gradients, so that the reading experience is visually comfortable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL use a color palette that excludes purple hues (hex values #800080 to #DDA0DD range)
2. THE Application SHALL remove all gradient backgrounds from components and pages
3. THE Application SHALL use solid colors or subtle background patterns for visual hierarchy
4. WHEN a User Interface element is rendered, THE User Interface SHALL display colors from an approved non-purple palette
5. THE Application SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA standard minimum 4.5:1)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent spacing and layout throughout the application, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Application SHALL maintain consistent padding within cards, containers, and content areas
3. THE Application SHALL apply consistent margins between sections and component groups

3. THE Application SHALL refactor the reading page to use only HeroUI components
4. THE Application SHALL refactor all admin pages to use only HeroUI components
5. THE Application SHALL refactor the profile, library, favorites, and coins pages to use only HeroUI components
6. WHEN any page is rendered, THE Application SHALL use HeroUI components exclusively for UI elements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved visual hierarchy and readability, so that I can easily navigate and understand the interface

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL use typography scale with clear size differentiation (headings, body, captions)
2. THE Application SHALL implement visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color contrast
3. THE Application SHALL use whitespace effectively to separate content groups
4. WHEN a User views a page, THE User Interface SHALL present information in a clear visual hierarchy
5. THE Application SHALL use HeroUI's typography components for all text rendering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme configuration updated to support the new design system, so that theming is consistent across the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL update tailwind.config.ts to define a non-purple color palette
2. THE Application SHALL configure HeroUI theme with custom colors that exclude purple
3. THE Application SHALL define light and dark mode color schemes
4. WHEN the theme is applied, THE Application SHALL render all components with the configured color palette
5. THE Application SHALL remove all gradient-related theme configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive elements to have clear hover and focus states, so that I understand what is clickable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL apply hover effects to all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards)
2. THE Application SHALL display focus indicators on keyboard-navigable elements
3. THE Application SHALL use HeroUI's built-in interaction states (hover, pressed, focus)
4. WHEN a User hovers over an interactive element, THE User Interface SHALL provide visual feedback within 100 milliseconds
5. THE Application SHALL maintain consistent interaction patterns across all components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want form components migrated to HeroUI, so that forms are consistent with the new design system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL replace all input fields with HeroUI Input components
2. THE Application SHALL replace all textarea fields with HeroUI Textarea components
3. THE Application SHALL replace all select dropdowns with HeroUI Select components
4. THE Application SHALL replace all dialog/modal components with HeroUI Modal components
5. WHEN a form is rendered, THE Application SHALL use HeroUI form components exclusively

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to be clean and accessible, so that I can easily move through the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL use HeroUI Navbar component with consistent styling
2. THE Application SHALL display navigation items with clear labels and appropriate spacing
3. THE Application SHALL provide mobile-responsive navigation with HeroUI's built-in responsive features
4. WHEN a User navigates on mobile devices, THE Application SHALL display a functional mobile menu
5. THE Application SHALL maintain navigation accessibility with proper ARIA labels

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want card components standardized with HeroUI, so that content presentation is consistent

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL use HeroUI Card component for all card-based layouts
