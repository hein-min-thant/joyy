# Temporary Fix for Schema Errors

## Problem

The schema has been updated to use chapters, but these pages still reference the old structure:
- `app/read/[id]/page.tsx` - tries to load pages by comicId
- `app/admin/upload/page.tsx` - tries to create pages with comicId
- `app/admin/edit/[id]/page.tsx` - tries to list/create pages with comicId

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Revert Schema (Quick Fix)
Temporarily revert the schema changes until frontend is ready:
- Keep pages linked to comics (not chapters)
- Implement chapters later

### Option 2: Complete Migration (Recommended)
Fully implement chapter system:
- Update all 3 pages to use chapters
- Create migration script for existing data

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Create a default chapter for each comic
- Auto-migrate pages to that chapter
- Update pages to work with chapters

## Recommended: Option 3 (Hybrid)

I can create a migration helper that:
1. Creates a "Chapter 1" for each existing comic
2. Moves all pages to that chapter
3. Updates the 3 pages to work with chapters

This way you get the chapter system without breaking existing data.

**Would you like me to implement Option 3?**

This will:
- Fix all errors
- Keep your existing data
- Enable the chapter system
- Maintain Geist design
