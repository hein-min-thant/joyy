# Next Steps - Chapter System Implementation

## What's Been Done ✅

1. **Schema updated** with chapters, chapterPurchases tables
2. **Backend API** created for chapters, chapter purchases, and access control
3. **Pages API** updated to work with chapters instead of comics

## What You Need To Do Now

### Step 1: Push Schema Changes
```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will apply the schema changes to your database.

### Step 2: Test the Backend

The backend is ready. You can test it by:
1. Creating a comic
2. Creating chapters for that comic
3. Adding pages to chapters

### Step 3: Update Frontend (I'll do this next)

I need to update these files:
- `app/comic/[id]/page.tsx` - Show chapter list
- `app/read/[comicId]/[chapterId]/page.tsx` - New reading page structure
- `app/admin/upload/page.tsx` - Chapter-based upload
- `app/admin/edit/[id]/page.tsx` - Chapter management

## Current Status

**Backend**: ✅ Complete and ready
**Frontend**: ⏳ Waiting for your confirmation to proceed

The schema changes are breaking changes. Once you run `npx convex dev`, the old page system won't work anymore.

**Do you want me to continue updating the frontend pages now?**

If yes, I'll update all the frontend pages to work with the new chapter system.
